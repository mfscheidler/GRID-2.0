MATSim

Multi-Agent Transport Simulation

http://matsim.org/

Release 0.8.0
=========================================================================


MATSim provides a toolbox to run and implement large-scale agent-based 
transport simulations. The toolbox consists of several modules which can be
combined or used stand-alone. Modules can be replaced by own implementations
to test single aspects of your own work. Currently, MATSim offers a toolbox
for demand-modeling, agent-based mobility-simulation (traffic flow simulation),
re-planning, a controller to iteratively run simulations as well as methods to
analyze the output generated by the modules.
